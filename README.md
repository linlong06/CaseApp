State Your CASE is a web-based survey applicaiton developed for National Youth Week.

As we are encouraging young people to use innovation to solve social problems, we have launched the CASE App. CASE stands for Conï¬‚ict, Anger, and Self-Esteem. This is a way for young people to self-identify if any of these are a challenge for them. We are hoping through this app, to provide data to empower youth to make a change if this is an area of concern.
